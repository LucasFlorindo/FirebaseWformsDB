Firebase is a Cloud Database host tool from google that doesnt deppend on u or ur client having a SQL sever management installed. 
In this Repository i'm creating an example using c# to setup FireBase as DB on a WindowsForms Application.


#Requirements:
- For using Firebase's FireSharp namespace, you should download FireSharp.Serialization.JsonNet DLL (Im using version 1.1.0)
- To find this dll u should go for Tab Project -> Manage Nuget Packages -> Browse "FireSharp.Serialization.JsonNet" -> Install.
- Create a firebase project at: https://console.firebase.google.com/
